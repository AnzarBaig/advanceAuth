# Advanced Authentication and Authorization System

This project is a result of following the tutorial video [LINK_TO_VIDEO_TITLE](LINK_TO_VIDEO) which demonstrates the implementation of an advanced authentication and authorization system in a MERN stack application.

## Description
The tutorial video focuses on the following key concepts and features:

- **Login and Register Authentication:** The video demonstrates how to set up secure authentication for user registration and login processes.

- **Password Hashing and Secure Storage:** The tutorial covers the implementation of password hashing techniques to ensure secure storage of user passwords.

- **JWT Generation and Frontend Storage:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are generated and stored on the frontend to facilitate secure communication and authentication between the client and server.

- **Private Routes in React.js:** The video explains how to create private routes in a React.js application to restrict access to authenticated users only.

- **Password Reset and Emailing:** The tutorial provides guidance on implementing password reset functionality and utilizing Nodemailer and SendGrid to send emails to users.

The video contains a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire process, with explanations and demonstrations of each stage. Timestamps are provided to help navigate through different sections of the video.
